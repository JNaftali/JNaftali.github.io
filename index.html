  <h1>Welcome to Josh's Dance Site</h1>
  <h3>A record of the different types of dance I've tried and the etiquette I had to learn for each.</h3>

<p>If you were wondering, those types of dance are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Israeli Dancing</li>
  <li>Contra Dancing</li>
  <li>Blues Dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>I've had varying amounts of experience with each type of dance, of course:</p>

  </header>
  <p>The biggest thing I like about this page is that it's clean. Aside from the header (which is the same on every page of the website) there are no images, not even any colors. Secondly, it's formatted to be easy to read. The important parts are bolded to make it easier to skim the text and find what you're looking for, and the headers break the page up into digestible chunks. I'm not sure, though, if a long drop-down menu is the best way to offer a visitor to navigate the site.</p>
